# 100 Days of Code Log

## 5/1/2021

- Began FSA Bootcamp Prep live course, covering code conventions, debugging, and loops. Was able to solve all practice problems (yay!).
- Afternoon session was on coercion and truthiness -- had a great partner (Corinne) and we were able to solve all problems pretty quickly together.

## 5/2/2021

- 2nd day of BCP course, morning session was focused on scope. Added section about functions and hoisting I didn't remember hearing in self-paced course, so that was good. Biggest takeaway: try not to have variables with the same names floating around, it makes things super confusing. Group wasn't interested in pair programming so will probably request solo for afternoon.
- Finished problems early, so did some more work on math game. Set up functions for starting game and if someone quits before game is over.
- Recorded self solving afternoon problems since I was working solo, breezed through them which I felt good about. Then I did a codewars problem and leveled up, yay!

## 5/3/2021

- Worked on 3 Leetcode problems (under easy but way more difficult than Codewars level 8). Thought the platform was cool but I definitely need more practice with algorithms and recognizing certain problem patterns.
- Covered more array methods in BCP, recorded self solving exercises -- this was the first group in the self-paced class I remember having a really hard time with. But luckily my brain absorbed the solutions because I was able to solve them all this time.

## 5/4/2021

- Worked on a leetcode problem on rotating arrays -- thought I was so cool and could use the solution I came up with for one of the problems last night. But it wasn't efficient enough for LC, but I read some of the hints and came up with another solution that passed. Hooray!
- Worked on math game, implemented game loop, checking answers. Problems included changing options in a dropdown based upon the input of other fields, parsing answers, updating state and managing callbacks.
- For BCP we covered objects, and some of the workshop problems were...not tough but complicated? I was feeling super tired tonight so I didn't record myself solving them, but I should try to do that from here on out because I think I would have had some trouble explaining why some of my solutions worked.

## 5/5/2021

- Worked on math game, finished testing basic game engine and building out UI and scoreboard. Had to take out sequential order option because figuring out the logic was hurting my brain and it wasn't totally necessary. Would be a nice thing to come back to in the future. Onward!
