## 5/25/2021

- Read first two chapters of Eloquent Javascript.
- Began setting up Twitch stuff for maybe some streamed coding (eek!)
- Did about 15 minutes of Anki

## 5/10/2021

- Took FSA coding assessment this morning -- way easier than the one I took previously on HackerRank (this one was on Coderbyte) and I'm 97% sure one of the problems was one I had done on Codewars before lol. Already got invited to interview, just trying to decide whether I want to continue to pursue the bootcamp or nah.
- Did 3 Codewars level 6 probs, focusing on arrays and strings.
- Began layout of math game with Bootstrap 5

## 5/9/2021

- In BCP, worked on recursion. I was a bit frustrated in the morning session as I didn't breeze through the problems. After getting a few hints, however, I took off and was able to do the rest independently (although some of the more complex problems took a bit to figure out). I definitely need to continue working on my problem solving process and not jumping right in and coding without planning.

## 5/8/2021

- Worked a bit on portfolio page. Just tweaks!
- In BCP, we covered higher-order functions. I was pleased that I didn't get tripped up on any of the exercises.
- Spent a fair amount of time troubleshooting my PHP capstone project, trying to get it to work on Heroku. That didn't work so now I'm going to do a screencast instead.

## 5/7/2021

- In math game, added ability to save scores to local storage.
- Did 2 level 7 Codewars, both string-related
- Signed up for pixelarity to access basic HTML templates for portfolio pieces. Could I code these all myself? Absolutely, but this is a great shortcut and a way to update some old portfolio projects.
- Finally figured out mysplice and was heartened to see that even Noor had problems with it during class. It's just a flipping hard problem lol!
- Started working on basic portfolio template. Not in love with the code in the template, but it's fine for now. Done is better than perfect!

## 5/6/2021

- Attempted 3 CodeWars problems, completed 2 and gave up on the last after trying for about 30 minutes. Dealt with converting an array of digits into a number, adding 1 and then converting it back. Could get basic tests working but not edge cases, boo! Will try again another day.
- Did some more work on the math game, bought a domain name (6 bucks whaaat). Continuing to test and fix any bugs, want it to be pretty solid before starting on UI.
- In BCP, we studied passing by value vs. reference -- in JS primitive types are passed by value and objects (arrays, functions, objects) are passed by reference. Noor wasn't feeling well, but we got the workshops from the free class and shared them with everyone. MySplice got me AGAIN, I must have worked on it for 45 minutes before giving up. I was able to do the rest, though. Will watch the solution to MySplice tomorrow and try it again.

## 5/5/2021

- Worked on math game, finished testing basic game engine and building out UI and scoreboard. Had to take out sequential order option because figuring out the logic was hurting my brain and it wasn't totally necessary. Would be a nice thing to come back to in the future. Onward!
- In BCP, we went a bit deeper into objects and I was really proud of the way I approached the more involved problems. I'm still doing a bit too much explaining that sounds like guessing, so I need to be a bit more confident in my explanation, but when it comes to actually solving problems well, I'm making progress.

## 5/4/2021

- Worked on a leetcode problem on rotating arrays -- thought I was so cool and could use the solution I came up with for one of the problems last night. But it wasn't efficient enough for LC, but I read some of the hints and came up with another solution that passed. Hooray!
- Worked on math game, implemented game loop, checking answers. Problems included changing options in a dropdown based upon the input of other fields, parsing answers, updating state and managing callbacks.
- For BCP we covered objects, and some of the workshop problems were...not tough but complicated? I was feeling super tired tonight so I didn't record myself solving them, but I should try to do that from here on out because I think I would have had some trouble explaining why some of my solutions worked.

## 5/3/2021

- Worked on 3 Leetcode problems (under easy but way more difficult than Codewars level 8). Thought the platform was cool but I definitely need more practice with algorithms and recognizing certain problem patterns. They had addtional parameters and edge cases that made them really challenging!
- Covered more array methods in BCP, recorded self solving exercises -- this was the first group in the self-paced class I remember having a really hard time with. But luckily my brain absorbed the solutions because I was able to solve them all this time.

## 5/2/2021

- 2nd day of BCP course, morning session was focused on scope. Added section about functions and hoisting I didn't remember hearing in self-paced course, so that was good. Biggest takeaway: try not to have variables with the same names floating around, it makes things super confusing. Group wasn't interested in pair programming so will probably request solo for afternoon.
- Finished problems early, so did some more work on math game. Set up functions for starting game and if someone quits before game is over.
- Recorded self solving afternoon problems since I was working solo, breezed through them which I felt good about. Then I did a codewars problem and leveled up, yay!

## 5/1/2021

- Began FSA Bootcamp Prep live course, covering code conventions, debugging, and loops. Was able to solve all practice problems (yay!).
- Afternoon session was on coercion and truthiness -- had a great partner (Corinne) and we were able to solve all problems pretty quickly together.
