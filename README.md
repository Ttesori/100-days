# 100 Days of Code Log

## 5/1/2021

- Began FSA Bootcamp Prep live course, covering code conventions, debugging, and loops. Was able to solve all practice problems (yay!).
- Afternoon session was on coercion and truthiness -- had a great partner (Corinne) and we were able to solve all problems pretty quickly together.

## 5/2/2021

- 2nd day of BCP course, morning session was focused on scope. Added section about functions and hoisting I didn't remember hearing in self-paced course, so that was good. Biggest takeaway: try not to have variables with the same names floating around, it makes things super confusing. Group wasn't interested in pair programming so will probably request solo for afternoon.
- Finished problems early, so did some more work on math game. Set up functions for starting game and if someone quits before game is over.
- Recorded self solving afternoon problems since I was working solo, breezed through them which I felt good about. Then I did a codewars problem and leveled up, yay!

## 5/3/2021

- Worked on 3 Leetcode problems (under easy but way more difficult than Codewars level 8). Thought the platform was cool but I definitely need more practice with algorithms and recognizing certain problem patterns.
- Covered more array methods in BCP, recorded self solving exercises -- this was the first group in the self-paced class I remember having a really hard time with. But luckily my brain absorbed the solutions because I was able to solve them all this time.

## 5/4/2021

- Worked on a leetcode problem on rotating arrays -- thought I was so cool and could use the solution I came up with for one of the problems last night. But it wasn't efficient enough for LC, but I read some of the hints and came up with another solution that passed. Hooray!
