# 100 Days of Code Log

## 5/1/2021

- Began FSA Bootcamp Prep live course, covering code conventions, debugging, and loops. Was able to solve all practice problems (yay!).
- Afternoon session was on coercion and truthiness -- had a great partner (Corinne) and we were able to solve all problems pretty quickly together.
