# 100 Days of Code Log

## 5/1/2021

- Began FSA Bootcamp Prep live course, covering code conventions, debugging, and loops. Was able to solve all practice problems (yay!).
- Afternoon session was on coercion and truthiness -- had a great partner (Corinne) and we were able to solve all problems pretty quickly together.

- 2nd day of BCP course, morning session was focused on scope. Added section about functions and hoisting I didn't remember hearing in self-paced course, so that was good. Biggest takeaway: try not to have variables with the same names floating around, it makes things super confusing. Group wasn't interested in pair programming so will probably request solo for afternoon.
