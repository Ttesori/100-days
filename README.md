# 100 Days of Code Log

## 7/21/2021 (Day 81)

- 🧩 Inspired by @blawblawblaw, I worked on a bunch of 8kyu Codewars problems today - still have like 300 to go though 😂
- 👩‍💻 Deployed my little emoji search app and spent quite some time trying to fix a few minor styling issues. One of them was an 'omg how did I miss that' moment, but that's how it goes!

## 7/20/2021 (Day 80)

-👩‍💻 Continued work on the React emoji search app! Implemented infinite scrolling and got a bug figured out with dark mode - I needed to change the class name on the root <html> element, not the <body> tag like I originally had implemented! Hoping I can get it deployed to Netlify tomorrow. Also managed to knock out the daily 100Devs problem! 🎉

## 7/19/2021 (Day 79)

- 👨‍👩‍👧 Olivia has a friend over for a sleepover, so mom duties took priority today! I did manage to complete the daily 100Devs problem, though, and spent some time on a Squarespace website for a work client. Hoping the kiddos sleep well tonight and I can have a more productive day tomorrow!

## 7/18/2021 (Day 78)

-👩‍💻 Worked more on emoji search mini app - learned how to implement dark mode in Tailwind (holy moly so easy) and did some work to figure out how to speed up search and rendering of such a large dataset (I had no idea there were so many emojis lol). Also played Stardew Family with Olivia because Sunday!

## 7/17/2021 (Day 77)

- 👩‍💻 Worked on mini app to help me understand the useContext/useReducer combo. I think I understand it now; the only issue I ran into was that since all the pieces of state are connected, they're all re-rendering each time one part is updated. Not sure if I'm doing something wrong or that's just how it works - need to research!

## 7/16/2021 (Day 76)

- 🧩 Completed daily 100Devs problem - good news, everyone: today's solution was much less of a hot mess than yesterday's! 😂
- 👀 Attended class and was incredibly motivated and inspired by @EdenGebrezgi and @dayheysoos who shared their journeys with us...and spilled all the tea. So thankful for them!

## 7/15/2021 (Day 75)

- 🧩 Completed daily 100Devs problem - my solution to this was a hot mess express, but after viewing the solution, I saw where I went wrong and was able to clean it up to a one-liner 😂
- 👩‍💻 Updated my portfolio to add GroceryMapper - woot!

## 7/14/2021 (Day 74)

- 🧩 Completed daily 100Devs problem - this one was on extracting the domain portion of a URL. I immediately jumped to trying to figure it out with regex...only to realize when we reviewed it that it could be solved much easier with .replace() and .split(). Good lesson on creative ways to use these methods!

## 7/13/2021 (Day 73)

- 🧩 Completed daily 100Devs problem - this one was on filtering duplicate words out of a string. Learned that there is a third parameter for .filter(el, i, arr) that you can use to get the array.

## 7/12/2021 (Day 72)

- 👩‍💻 Finished up GroceryMapper and put the link out for the general public to see lol. Holy vulnerability hangover Batman!
- 👩‍💻 Started up a mini-app to practice React Context/Reducers, more Tailwind (specifically dark themes) and CSS Grid.
- 🧩 Finished daily 100Devs problem - felt good about my problem-solving process with this one. Feeling much more confident with higher-order functions like map, reduce, etc.

## 7/11/2021 (Day 71)

- 👩‍💻 Well, uncovered some new issues when testing (of course), so no link for GroceryMapper available yet. But it's so close! In the meantime, here's a fun screenshot of the home/landing page - I love the illustration I found on Storyset 😍
  ![GroceryMapper landing page](https://grocerymap.app/img/gm-screenshot.png)

## 7/10/2021 (Day 70)

- 👩‍💻 I still have some testing to do tomorrow, but I think I'm at a solid version 1 stopping place for the React GroceryMapper app! Yay!
- 🎨 Finally checked CSS Grid Garden off of my to-do list! So now I'm going through @wesbos' CSS Grid course to deepen my learning and help it all sink in.

## 7/9/2021 (Day 69 👀)

- 👩‍💻 Still working on grocery app desktop design. But I've moved on to the landing/home page now. The finish line is in sight!
- 🧩 Completed 100devs daily problem - was super pumped because I figured this one out right off the bat. Much better than yesterday!
- ☕️ Listened to @IbrahimCodes share his dev journey. So thankful for his openness (he spilled alll the tea) and incredibly inspired by his story!

## 7/8/2021 (Day 68)

- 🧩 Completed 100Devs daily problem - was really stumped for ~30mins but finally figured out the answer by examining the test cases. Also learned about the Set data structure in JS!
- 👩‍💻 Continued work on the desktop design for grocery app - just a few odds and ends to test and tweak and then an initial (very imperfect!) version should be ready for y'all to try out - yay!

## 7/7/2021 (Day 67)

- 🧩 Completed 100Devs Daily Coding Challenge using .reduce() - getting better at these methods! Also attended a quick standup where we went over the problem/solution, which was really helpful.
- 👩‍💻 Back to work on desktop design for GroceryMapper - actually made good progress today. It was nice to get back to it after a couple of days away!

## 7/6/2021 (Day 66)

- 👀 Attended 100Devs class, which is always incredibly motivational and inspiring. So many incredible folks working hard to get tech jobs and better their lives and their communities - I love it! Other than that, a low-tech day - helped my parents buy their first house in 30 years...so that was quite the experience 🤪

## 7/5/2021 (Day 65)

- 🚫 Ugh, my first zero day! I opened up my computer and started to code, but after about 15 minutes I wasn't focusing, accomplishing anything or even enjoying the process 😂 I haven't slept well for a couple of nights, so I'm chalking it up as an indication that it's time to focus on self-care and take a night off!

## 7/4/2021 (Day 65)

- 👩‍💻 I finally quit my procrastinating and got serious about working on the desktop design for my grocery list app 😂 I'm not in love with it, but I think it's good enough for me to begin coding, so hopefully I can make some headway on that tomorrow. No hope of concentrating on any serious coding tonight with errrryone around me shooting off fireworks lol 🎆

## 7/3/2021 (Day 64)

- 👩‍💻 Spent the day procrastinating working on the desktop version of the grocery list app because I'm completely drawing a blank on the design. I open xD, move some boxes around, think 'nope,' and go back to tweaking the mobile version 😂...procrastination activities today included adding Twitter and Google login options so at least I did something useful!

## 7/2/2021 (Day 63)

- 👩‍💻 Added 'Email List to Friend' functionality to GroceryMapper - discovered in the process that on Netlify needs an \_redirects file in the /public folder to make it play nicely with BrowserRouter. Hoping by writing this down I'll remember it next time!
- 🐞 Broke list updating whoops! I added a new field that was defaulting to undefined and Firestore did NOT like that - had to use an empty string instead!

## 7/1/2021 (Day 62)

- 👩‍💻 Did one Codewars and one Leetcode problem!
- 👀 Attended #100Devs class on @Azure Cognitive Services - learned how to use the speech recognition and translation. Amazing!
- Hung out with OCC as she attempted to play Flexbox Froggy while the 100Devs group showed out lol

## 6/30/2021 (Day 61)

- 👩‍💻 Got back to work styling GroceryMapper, mostly the 'Add New List' page. Was a bit stuck on styling alerts; I def need to work on my CSS animation skills lol! I've noticed when I get to the point in a project where there's a bunch of little things to work on but nothing major, I end up wasting time figuring out what to do first!

## 6/29/2021 (Day 60)

- 👀 Attended #100Devs class on using Microsoft Cognitive Services to utilize machine learning in our applications. So cool - we built the hot dog/not hot dog app from Silicon Valley 😂
- 👩‍💻 Did one single solitary Leetcode problem...I did not even open up GroceryMapper today! 😬

## 6/28/2021 (Day 59)

- 👩‍💻 Kept working on styling Grocery Mapper - added loading animation and tested the styling I've done so far, refining a few things here and there. Nothing ready for prime time tonight - hopefully I'll have a new video to share tomorrow 👍

## 6/27/2021 (Day 58)

- 👩‍💻 You guessed it, I kept working on styling the React grocery list app! Couple of notes from today: 1) be sure to use the correct font-family and font-weight when using a FontAwesome icon as a checkmark and 2) use -webkit-fill-available to vertically center content properly on mobile. 👍

## 6/26/2021 (Day 57)

- 👩‍💻 Kept working on styling for the React grocery list app! Not too much to say today - making 🐢-like progress, but it's progress nonetheless!

## 6/25/2021 (Day 56)

- 👩‍💻 Knocked out a Leetcode problem this morning and then continued work on styling the React grocery app. Still really digging Tailwind (to my complete shock), and am just methodically going through the screens and styling up each one based on the mockups I made earlier this week. Slow but steady progress! 🐢

## 6/24/2021 (Day 55)

- 👩‍💻 Continued work on designing mockups for React app and began basic mobile styling of the bare bones home page. You guys, I think I like Tailwind a lot? Instead of inline classes, I'm primarily using @apply with my own classes and it's still saving me a ton of time!

## 6/23/2021 (Day 54)

- 🧩 Took a bit of a break today and did a few Leetcode problems - going to try to keep doing one or so of these a day to work on my problem-solving skills.
- 👩‍💻 Did a bit of cleanup/organization and accessibility work on the React app, but nothing too major

## 6/22/2021 (Day 53)

- 👩‍💻 Set up the production environment for the React grocery app - hosting and database permissions. Figuring out the Firestore security rules was crazy, but I did it, woot! Also started some basic UI work on XD, soo excited to get some styling on this app so I'm not looking at grey blah-ness!
- 👀 #100Devs class & WWC Tampa meeting, both on technical interviewing!

## 6/21/2021 (Day 52)

- 👩‍💻 More progress on the React app...finished up database integration - once I got the hang of Firestore it was pretty user-friendly! Also decided to add Tailwind to this project - not sure how I feel about all the class names on the elements, but I like the @apply syntax, so I can use them more like shortcuts! Cue everyone telling me how this is a horrible way to use Tailwind...

## 6/20/2021 (Day 51)

- 👩‍💻 Zomg actual progress on the React authentication/database front today 🎉 I spent what felt like forever trying to figure out how to use Firebase Auth and Firestore, but I finally got auth implemented and have 1 of my data structures using the database. _cue happy dance_

## 6/19/2021 (Day 50)

- Halfway through! My brain was mostly like nahhh after driving today, but I did start researching authentication and database options for React. Should I go with Firebase? AWS Amplify? Serverless? Trying to figure it out!

## 6/18/2021 (Day 49)

- 👩‍💻 I'm continuing to make slow but steady progress on the React app...got basic functionality working, so the next step will be adding authentication and storage. Before all that though, I've got to do some styling because looking at this plain app all day is making me sad 😭

## 6/17/2021 (Day 48)

- 👩‍💻 Still working on React grocery list app...it seemed every time I fixed something, I introduced another problem or realized some additional complexity. I also try to keep optimizing/organizing my code before getting it stable, which I know is a no-no. I just can't help it lol!

## 6/16/2021 (Day 47)

- 👩‍💻 Continued to chip away at the React grocery list app - started working on the list creation portion, but my brain was noooot firing on all cylinders, so I didn't get as much done as I would have liked. Hoping I get a good night's sleep tonight and tomorrow is better! 😴

## 6/15/2021 (Day 46)

- 👩‍💻 Kept working on React grocery list app - got CRUD functionality for stores working, yay! Also attempted to come up with a plan for organizing components...which I sort of implemented, but also turned into kind of a mess 😂 So far I've learned quite a bit about routing and state management! 👍

## 6/14/2021 (Day 45)

- 👩‍💻 Continued work on React grocery list app; spent time figuring out how to use react-beautiful-dnd, but it was certainly easier than implementing drag and drop from scratch! Now just thinking about how to organize components and which parts to work on first...

## 6/13/2021 (Day 44)

- 👩‍💻 Got Expense Tracker deployed and I'm gonna call it good for now. Will share a link super soon!
- 🛒 Already started on the next thing 😂 It is going to be a React project (hooray!) for putting your grocery list in the order that you traverse the store. I've been doing this manually for years, going to be nice to have an app for it! First step is figuring out drag & drop...

## 6/12/2021 (Day 43)

- 👩‍💻 Worked on finishing up v1 of the expense tracker app. Finally wrapped up styling login and register pages - don't know why I put this off for so long, I love them! Big things left are testing responsiveness and accessibility.
- 🤝 Became familiar with the inner workings of replit when working on setup for group project app - a really impressive, powerful application!

## 6/11/2021 (Day 42)

- 🙌 Attended day 2 of the @WomenWhoCode conference - more wonderful sessions from @_tiffanydawson_ @isabelcmdcosta @Dominika_M @Shona_k and so many others!

- Wrapped up initial styling of holidays app admin and fixed a quick JS issue.

## 5/25/2021

- Completed one 5kyu kata on determining whether words are anagrams and another 6kyu kata on building a tower out of asterisks and spaces -- both were challenging, but fun, and I added .repeat() to my Anki so I don't forget about it!

- Read first two chapters of Eloquent Javascript.
- Began setting up Twitch stuff for maybe some streamed coding (eek!)
- Did about 15 minutes of Anki

## 5/10/2021

- Took FSA coding assessment this morning -- way easier than the one I took previously on HackerRank (this one was on Coderbyte) and I'm 97% sure one of the problems was one I had done on Codewars before lol. Already got invited to interview, just trying to decide whether I want to continue to pursue the bootcamp or nah.
- Did 3 Codewars level 6 probs, focusing on arrays and strings.
- Began layout of math game with Bootstrap 5

## 5/9/2021

- In BCP, worked on recursion. I was a bit frustrated in the morning session as I didn't breeze through the problems. After getting a few hints, however, I took off and was able to do the rest independently (although some of the more complex problems took a bit to figure out). I definitely need to continue working on my problem solving process and not jumping right in and coding without planning.

## 5/8/2021

- Worked a bit on portfolio page. Just tweaks!
- In BCP, we covered higher-order functions. I was pleased that I didn't get tripped up on any of the exercises.
- Spent a fair amount of time troubleshooting my PHP capstone project, trying to get it to work on Heroku. That didn't work so now I'm going to do a screencast instead.

## 5/7/2021

- In math game, added ability to save scores to local storage.
- Did 2 level 7 Codewars, both string-related
- Signed up for pixelarity to access basic HTML templates for portfolio pieces. Could I code these all myself? Absolutely, but this is a great shortcut and a way to update some old portfolio projects.
- Finally figured out mysplice and was heartened to see that even Noor had problems with it during class. It's just a flipping hard problem lol!
- Started working on basic portfolio template. Not in love with the code in the template, but it's fine for now. Done is better than perfect!

## 5/6/2021

- Attempted 3 CodeWars problems, completed 2 and gave up on the last after trying for about 30 minutes. Dealt with converting an array of digits into a number, adding 1 and then converting it back. Could get basic tests working but not edge cases, boo! Will try again another day.
- Did some more work on the math game, bought a domain name (6 bucks whaaat). Continuing to test and fix any bugs, want it to be pretty solid before starting on UI.
- In BCP, we studied passing by value vs. reference -- in JS primitive types are passed by value and objects (arrays, functions, objects) are passed by reference. Noor wasn't feeling well, but we got the workshops from the free class and shared them with everyone. MySplice got me AGAIN, I must have worked on it for 45 minutes before giving up. I was able to do the rest, though. Will watch the solution to MySplice tomorrow and try it again.

## 5/5/2021

- Worked on math game, finished testing basic game engine and building out UI and scoreboard. Had to take out sequential order option because figuring out the logic was hurting my brain and it wasn't totally necessary. Would be a nice thing to come back to in the future. Onward!
- In BCP, we went a bit deeper into objects and I was really proud of the way I approached the more involved problems. I'm still doing a bit too much explaining that sounds like guessing, so I need to be a bit more confident in my explanation, but when it comes to actually solving problems well, I'm making progress.

## 5/4/2021

- Worked on a leetcode problem on rotating arrays -- thought I was so cool and could use the solution I came up with for one of the problems last night. But it wasn't efficient enough for LC, but I read some of the hints and came up with another solution that passed. Hooray!
- Worked on math game, implemented game loop, checking answers. Problems included changing options in a dropdown based upon the input of other fields, parsing answers, updating state and managing callbacks.
- For BCP we covered objects, and some of the workshop problems were...not tough but complicated? I was feeling super tired tonight so I didn't record myself solving them, but I should try to do that from here on out because I think I would have had some trouble explaining why some of my solutions worked.

## 5/3/2021

- Worked on 3 Leetcode problems (under easy but way more difficult than Codewars level 8). Thought the platform was cool but I definitely need more practice with algorithms and recognizing certain problem patterns. They had addtional parameters and edge cases that made them really challenging!
- Covered more array methods in BCP, recorded self solving exercises -- this was the first group in the self-paced class I remember having a really hard time with. But luckily my brain absorbed the solutions because I was able to solve them all this time.

## 5/2/2021

- 2nd day of BCP course, morning session was focused on scope. Added section about functions and hoisting I didn't remember hearing in self-paced course, so that was good. Biggest takeaway: try not to have variables with the same names floating around, it makes things super confusing. Group wasn't interested in pair programming so will probably request solo for afternoon.
- Finished problems early, so did some more work on math game. Set up functions for starting game and if someone quits before game is over.
- Recorded self solving afternoon problems since I was working solo, breezed through them which I felt good about. Then I did a codewars problem and leveled up, yay!

## 5/1/2021

- Began FSA Bootcamp Prep live course, covering code conventions, debugging, and loops. Was able to solve all practice problems (yay!).
- Afternoon session was on coercion and truthiness -- had a great partner (Corinne) and we were able to solve all problems pretty quickly together.
